# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
In this lesson, we were introduced to the various types of sorting algorithms using the C programming language

# General Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:
- Explain at least four different sorting algorithms
- Explain Big O notation, and describe how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- Explain how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- Define a stable sorting algorithm
